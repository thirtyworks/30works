    <p>
        is a free month-long project where participating artists create and submit a
        new piece of work every day during April. The project is open to anyone working in any
        media, anywhere in the world. Artists that participate can also access peer mentoring,
        network support and engage with other artists taking part in the project.
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary rule of the project is that you must submit an artwork every day. If you fail to
        submit an artwork on one of the days, you are out of the project.
    </p>

    <h4 class="fw-light">12Ã¸ collective began 30/30 in 2015 to encourage making and experimentation. With the restriction of one day you may find that the choices you make, the corners you cut, and those ideas that you couldn't quite realise, are just as telling as the work that you produce.</h4>
