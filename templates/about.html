<h1>30works30days</h1>
    <p>
        is a month-long project for makers where participants are required to submit a new piece of work every day for the month of April. If they fail to submit something one day, they are out of the project. The project is open to everyone and any medium is encouraged. In 2021 over 571 artists of all ages are participating from 30 countries around the world!!
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.12ocollective.com/">12ø</a>  began 30/30 in 2015 to encourage making and experimentation. With the time restriction of one day you may find that the choices you make, the corners you cut, and those ideas that you couldn’t quite realise, are just as telling as the work that you produce.</p>
    <p>
        You will be able to see everyone’s work everyday throughout April on the live feed using the 30/30 icon (top left) and by following #30works30days. Each day a selection of the day's works are picked by a different special art guest and displayed on Instagram. For more information please go to the <a href="https://www.12ocollective.com/">12ø website</a> or email us at info@thirty.works
    </p>
    <p>
        We will be organising three workshops with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaajel_patel/" target="_blank">Kaajel Patel</a>, <a href="http://portfolio.smeech.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sam Meech</a> and <a href="https://bethbramich.com/" target="_blank">Beth Bramich</a> who will facilitate an opportunity for participants to make work, as well as to check-in and talk to each other about the work they’re making. While these events will be available to all 30/30 participants, some sessions may have limited spaces. You’ll receive an email with a link detailing the host and the event, so that you can book a place. Once we confirm your place, you will receive a link to the event on Zoom.
    <p>
        This year’s 30/30 has kindly been supported by <a href=""></a>Artquest, Arts Council England and all of you… and us!
