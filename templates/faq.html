    <ul>
      <li>At the top of the submission page you'll find the brief - you don't have to follow the brief, it is just a little prompt if you want it.</li>
      <li>Add the title of the work</li>
      <li>Add the format you're using</li>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <li>If you submit an image or a video/sound link <b>you need to include a visual description</b> 
          of the work, so anyone using screen readers on the webpage knows what your work looks like. 
          (<a class="link-success" href="https://www.perkinselearning.org/technology/blog/how-write-alt-text-and-image-descriptions-visually-impaired">here's a guide on how to write them.</a>)

        <li>Please be sure to write a visual description of your image, video link or sound link, and include your instagram handle (if you have one). If you don't include a visual description you won't be chosen for the daily picks.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>'Anything else to say…' is a place for you to share whatever you'd like, only Artquest will see it - this is not public.</li>
      <li>And finally tick the box at the bottom if <b class="text-decoration-underline">you do not want</b>  anyone to see you work. While your work won't show in the daily feed it has still been submitted. It will only be visible on your <b>My Works</b>  and Artquest will be able to see it.</li>
      <li>Once you've submitted, you will see a page confirming the submission of your work, and you'll be able to view your work on the daily feed (if you did NOT select private) and in the <b>My Works</b> section.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want to edit your work for that day, you can do so by going to <b>My Works</b> and selecting the <b>edit</b> button on the bottom right hand side of the submission. You can also delete your submission if you want and start again.</li>
        <li>You can change if you want to make it private or visible here too.</li>
